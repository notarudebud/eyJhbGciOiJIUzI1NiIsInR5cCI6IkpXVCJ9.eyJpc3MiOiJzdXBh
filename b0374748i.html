    <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight mb-6">SUBJECT: Sorry for the trolling (A)</h1>

    <article id="note" class="rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm leading-relaxed dark:border-slate-800 dark:bg-slate-900">
      <p class="mb-4">hello it's shian > i am NOT obsessed with you nor do i have a crush on you (pls believeüôè). You probably found my alt accounts (all was to see if my "specific project" was working, none of the users were handpicked. My "specific project" looked around possible "filipino themed" usernames to create all those accounts.)</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Now, you may be wondering. Why did two accounts have "chrome hearts addict" (1) and "asawa ni alyanna"? (2)</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>My old crush from YEARS ago was deeply obsessed with Chrome Hearts, and had a massive collection. I did put "chrome hearts" in my "specific project" username categories</li>
        <li>Name of said individual</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="mb-4">No, I did not make you my profile picture for both instagram and tiktok. It may resemble one of ur pictures posted on ur alt account (sent by someone confronting me) but it is NOT you, It is weird that it literally resembles the picture you posted but again. It isnt you (its a drawing made by someone i've known for several years.)</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I (included my "friends") apologize for trolling you on tiktok, instagram and facebook. We do not have a crush on you nor are we "obsessed" with you.. I (we) didn't want to come off in a weird way and i (we) truly apologize for seeming weird, Again we apologize and if you got uncomfortable at a specific point ‚Äî We are really sorry.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I will not be saying the name of the "specific project" as it would probably reveal my online identify and i want to keep that away from IRL individuals. It does exist because you might hit us with the "doesn't want to say the name or he just doesn't exist?!" And again, we are deeply sorry for making you uncomfortable. I hope my friends won't message you again in a way that would make you uncomfortable, The idea to message/troll you originally came from Ke and Jo. I trolled you first then Xa dared Ga and Ar(Kh) to message and troll you.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I do not want to be labeled as someones whos "obsessed" with you, and for the last time again (i hope). I apologize for the mistakes my friends and i made, we hope to never do this again and i assure you we won't be the next people who's gonna be trolling you like this.</p>

      <p class="mb-2">i'm not gay ;<br>
      No, he didn't tell me or the entire friend group anything. He refused to show us any messages and also refused to tell us what he and you said. You probably thought he said something to me because of my note "we're not gay bro" when you asked him if we were gay to each other (he told me this after you messaged him on tiktok, i do not know anything about you twos tiktok conversations)</p>
      <p class="mb-0"> The note "we're not gay bro" were meant for the gay allegations i was getting in a gc i was added in that day.</p>
      <p class="mb-0"> ^ We're not blaiming you ^</p>
